# Introduction

## Overview

Edduus Hub is a service protocol for building a decentralized education system. It is also a multi-asset, interoperable, proof-of-stake blockchain built on the [Cosmos SDK](http://cosmos.network/).

Edduus - a new global education system. Where every learner is interconnected on the blockchain and managed by a symbiotic AI using the Edduus AMM. Imagine a completely new global system of education - single, seamless, personalised and affordable. Edduus is a system of learners dynamically connected together in an ecosystem. With Edduus there are no institutions, just learners co-joined at a point in time around a common piece of learning. Edduus is the first-of-its-kind teaching and learning system incorporating the Edduus AMM, AI architecture and blockchain technology. Edduus makes education personalised, engaging and uniquely affordable for everyone.

## Why Blockchain

Edduus will revolutionize the way people learn with a new model built on the principles of artificial intelligence, gamification and blockchain technology Underpinned by a token-based model, the Edduus platform offers a first-of-its-kind incentive system to the benefit of both teachers and students. Our decentralized ecosystem will pay students for learning and remunerate teachers according to their impact in the success of their students. Itâ€™s simple: get rewarded for the things you achieve in real currency.
